This repository contains implementations of **online learning algorithms** for **dynamic pricing** of multiple products under production constraints. It is part of a course project on *Online Learning Applications*.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Dynamic pricing is a key strategy for maximizing revenue while managing limited inventory. In this project:  

- Buyers arrive sequentially with valuations for each product.  
- The company sets prices dynamically per round.  
- Buyers purchase products priced below their valuation.  
- Production capacity limits how many products can be sold in total.

We explore **stochastic**, **slightly non-stationary**, and **highly non-stationary environments** with multiple algorithms.
